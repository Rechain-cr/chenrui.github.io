Welcome to Anran li's academic homepage

I graduated from [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/)Ôºåand I am currently working as a formulation development engineer at [Aidea Pharma](https://aidea.com.cn/)  in Jiangsu, China. 

I specialize in drug delivery, innovative drug discovery, 3D printed drugs and other research. 

If you are looking for any kind of academic collaboration, please feel free to email me at lianran.cpu@gmail.com.

If you want to know more about me, here is my [CV](/CV.pdf).

The Pharmaceutical and Computational Fluid Dynamics Study of 3D Printed OP Tablets (Co-author, In Submission)

Siyuan Liu, Ke Zhang, **Anran li**, Zhijun Wang, Xiaofei Li, Jianbing Ren, Jianjun Zhang, Yunyi Shi, Yuan Gao, Shuai Qian, Yuanfeng Wei

**Project**
- The aim of this study was to prepare OP 3D-printed tablets using 3D-printing technology to achieve consistent in vitro release with the reference formulation, as well as to examine the key process parameters during the 3D-printing process.
  
- Dissolution morphology revealed that the 3D printed tablets dissolved mainly in surface dissolution, dissolution at multiple layers and side pore enlargement, which led to faster dissolution release and demonstrated the superiority of the model design.
